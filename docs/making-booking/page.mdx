# Making a Booking
Let's start with making bookings on the Edalem platform.

In this guide, we'll show you how to make a booking using both ways.

# Manual booking

## Fill in the form manually
After choosing the tour and date you'll see a booking form designed by your Supplier. 
This information is needed to organize the tour, so, **please fill the form correctly**.
You can fill the form manually by adding all the details or you can choose the voucher on your computer and the system will fill the form automatically.
Let's start with the **manual** way.

## Pick up place
When filling the form it's important to choose a **pickup place** (usually, hotel name). 
The system will automatically detect the geo-zone of this hotel and show available options for the transfers.
