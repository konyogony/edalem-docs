## Fill in the form manually
After choosing the tour and date you'll see a booking form designed by your Supplier. 
This information is needed to organize the tour, so, **please fill the form correctly**.
You can fill the form manually by adding all the details or you can choose the voucher on your computer and the system will fill the form automatically.
Let's start with the **manual** way.
