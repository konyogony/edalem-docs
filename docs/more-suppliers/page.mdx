# Adding More Suppliers

How to work with multiple Suppliers within single Agent account.


Agents can work with multiple Travel Suppliers and have access to their tours directly from one Agent's account. 
On step 2 [(how to add your first Supplier)](/add-supplier) we've successfully added one Supplier to our Agent's account.

Before adding the Supplier please contact Supplier's team to get your credentials. 
You need to get Supplier ID (Identificator), Agent Login and Agent Password.
