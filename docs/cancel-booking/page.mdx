# Cancel booking for Agent

<Alert type="warning" title="Important!">
Cancellation rules are defined by **Supplier** and could be different from tour to tour. As an Agent you need to have **full information** about cancellation policy for every Tour/Excursion
</Alert>


As an **example** we'll take a Tour with cancellation policy below: 
- Agent is allowed to cancel the booking day before the Tour date before 18:00 local time with no cancellation fee from the Supplier side
- Agent will pay 100% cancellation fee if they want to cancel the booking after 18:00 day before the tour date.

Let's say —  today is 31.12.2024.

Below you can see how system will work with both cases.
