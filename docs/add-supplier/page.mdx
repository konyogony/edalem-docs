# How to add a new Supplier

After successful verification of the Agent's account you need to add your first Supplier to have access to travel products *(tours)* of this Supplier.
If an Agent doesn't add Supplier to the Agent's account on Edalem, the system can't show any tours to make reservations.

## Getting credentials

Before adding the Supplier please contact Supplier's team to get your credentials. You need to get **Supplier ID** (Identificator), **Agent Login** and **Agent Password**.
